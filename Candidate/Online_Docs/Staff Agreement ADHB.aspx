					    In the course of carrying out your duties you are likely to have access to systems containing a broad range of patient and other personal information. All ADHB staff/contractors are therefore in trusted positions, and are expected to perform their duties responsibly. These duties include upholding the law by meeting the requirements of the <u>Privacy Act 1993</u> and the <u>Health Information Privacy Code 1994</u>, and complying with <u>ADHB Policy</u> with respect to how patient and other personal information is managed, and appropriate use of ADHB’s systems and technology.

According to the <u>Health Information Privacy Code 1994</u>, ADHB must ensure that patient information is protected against access, use, modification or disclosure by anyone, other than for patient care or other authorised purposes. We must also ensure that if health information is used for authorised purposes other than patient care, then wherever possible the information must be used in a form in which individual patients are not identified, and should not be published (i.e. printed) in a form that could identify individual patients. Patients have a right to expect their information will be managed appropriately.
To ensure compliance with the law, the Board Policy on <u>Access to Patient Information</u> states that "Only those staff members involved in the care and treatment of a patient may have access to that person's clinical records". This Policy also states that any staff wishing to view their own clinical records should request to view their records. Furthermore, the Board Policy <u>Legal Issues Related to Children in Hospital</u> states that parents and guardians must officially request access to the clinical records of their children, and that "<i>parents and guardians do not have an <u>automatic</u> right to access their child's clinical records</i>".

ADHB accepts that you will need to access/use patient and other personal information at times to perform your duties; however this does not entitle you to access/use patient information beyond the specific requirements of your job. You are expected to observe ADHB policy at all times. Any misuse of ADHB’s information systems will be regarded as a breach of ADHB Policy which could result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment/contract. Regular audits are conducted on ADHB’s information systems to identify potential breaches of ADHB Policy (including inappropriate access to patient information), and all staff are subject to systematic audit on a regular basis. Internet use (including sites visited) is also monitored on a regular basis and any inappropriate Internet use will have Internet access for that user removed without notice.
